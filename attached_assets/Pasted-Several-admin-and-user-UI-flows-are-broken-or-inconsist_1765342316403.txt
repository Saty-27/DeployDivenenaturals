Several admin and user UI flows are broken or inconsistent. Fix UI styling, interaction states, form failures, slow updates, and page layout so all admin pages share a common header/footer and consistent theme. Also make the newsletter area redirect to a newsletter card/list. Provide clear error handling and stable create/update actions for categories, products and subscriptions.

Tasks (priority order)
1) Admin: homepage — theme & newsletter

Problem: Admin homepage currently shows a black/transparent form that looks wrong and does not match admin banner/theme.

Request:

Apply the admin “banner” theme (colors, spacing, header) consistently on admin/homepage.

Convert the newsletter section to a clear CTA that redirects to the newsletter card/list view (not an inline broken form). Clicking the CTA should open the newsletter list or the newsletter-create card.

Acceptance criteria:

Admin homepage uses the banner theme (same header, title style, primary button).

Newsletter area has one clear action button: View Newsletters (redirects to newsletter list) and Create Newsletter (opens card/modal).

No transparent black form visible.

2) Add sidebar + fix active/inactive button state

Problem: There is no functional sidebar or wrong visual state for active/inactive buttons. Buttons do not show active/inactive properly.

Request:

Add a left sidebar (collapsible) consistent with admin theme.

Ensure active menu item has a visible active style (highlight, left border or background) and inactive items are un-highlighted.

Ensure buttons that toggle active/inactive update both visually and in data (API).

Acceptance criteria:

Sidebar present on admin pages, links work.

Active menu item visibly different from others.

Toggling active/inactive reflects immediately in UI and persists.

3) Admin/subscriptions — failing to create subscription

Problem: Creating a subscription shows “failed to add subscription”.

Request:

Reproduce the creation flow; capture network response and server error message.

If API returns validation error, show user-friendly validation messages inline.

Fix create API call or client payload (fields, headers, auth).

Reproduction steps (for dev):

Go to /admin/subscriptions, fill the subscription form, click Create → observe error message and check console/network.

Acceptance criteria:

Creating a subscription returns 200/201 and newly created subscription appears in the list.

On failure, show clear error message (e.g., “Missing field: price”) and a retry option.

4) Admin/delivery — cancel button text & styling

Problem: Black button with no readable text — needs white “Cancel” text.

Request:

For the cancel/danger buttons in delivery page, ensure button background and text contrast: add white text on dark background or flip to outline style.

Ensure button has aria-label and accessible contrast.

Acceptance criteria:

Cancel button shows readable “Cancel” text (white) with accessible contrast.

Hover/focus/active styles present.

5) User side: card add/update is very slow

Problem: When user adds a card (or a product/card), the update takes long and the UX shows delay.

Request:

Profile the client & server to identify bottleneck (client awaiting entire list vs. optimistic UI).

Implement optimistic update: show card immediately while completing background save.

Show spinner/disabled state while saving, and error toast if save fails.

Acceptance criteria:

Adding a card shows immediate UI feedback (optimistic) and then saves in background.

If server fails, the UI shows error and rollback option.

6) Admin category & product forms — "failed to make / doctyle error / authorized error"

Problem: Submitting category form shows “failed to make” or “doctype error”. Clicking product page shows “authorized error”.

Request:

Reproduce both flows and capture server responses (validation errors, 4xx/5xx or CORS/Auth errors).

Validate client payloads: required fields, content-type, file uploads (multipart).

Fix front-end validation to avoid sending malformed data (doctype errors usually come from wrong file or body type).

Ensure product page access uses correct auth token/permissions; if user lacks permission show a policy message, not raw error.

Acceptance criteria:

Category creation succeeds when valid data provided.

Product page loads for authorized users with correct data.

If unauthorized, show “You don’t have permission to view this page” with a contact/admin action.

7) Consolidate pages under main layout

Problem: Pages like /natural/home, /natural/subscription, /natural/order, /billing, /auth/login look like separate fragments and do not share the main header/footer.

Request:

Create a consistent main layout (header + footer + sidebar for admin) and wrap all admin pages with it.

Ensure /auth/login uses the same header/footer if required (or a minimal version) so pages feel cohesive.

Keep consistent spacing, fonts and primary actions.

Acceptance criteria:

All listed pages render with consistent header/footer and main layout.

Navigation between these pages retains layout (no full page layout jumps).

Suggested bug report template (copy into tracker)

Title: [Area] Short description (e.g. Admin/subscriptions: subscription creation fails)
Priority: High / Medium / Low
Environment: staging / production (browser, OS, user)
Steps to reproduce: numbered steps
Actual result: error message / UI behavior
Expected result: what should happen
Console / Network: attach screenshots or copy of server response
Suggested fix / notes: optional dev hints (payload shape, auth header, optimistic UI)

Quick test cases to include with each fix

Create subscription with valid data → subscription shows in list.

Create category with image and no image → both succeed with proper messages.

Product page load when logged in as admin → shows products; as guest → shows permission error message.

Click newsletter CTA on admin/home → opens newsletter list/modal.

Toggle active/inactive on sidebar → visually updates and persists.

Add card on user page → immediate UI feedback + save complete.

Small UX suggestions (optional, but helpful)

Use consistent primary color and banner for admin header (your existing banner theme).

Use toasts for success/error messages (top-right) with concise copy.

Use skeleton loaders for lists instead of long spinner.

Use optimistic updates for quick user feedback.

Log network error bodies to Sentry (or similar) for rapid debugging.
